So we created a Chrome extension \"Kartuli Glasses\" which turns all latin letters into Georgian for those Georgians who can read in Georgian but not in latin letters.\r\n \r\n* Mac (Mavericks)\r\n * System can be put in Georgian, but no programs actually seem to implement it\r\n \r\n* iPhone\r\n * Has no keyboard for Georgian\r\n * Has no system language for Georgian\r\n \r\n* Chrome\r\n * Has system language for Georgian\r\n * Has input language for Georgian \r\n * Seems to have no effect on a Mac (still says navigator.language = en-US)\r\n * Can contribute Chromium translations https://translations.launchpad.net/chromium-browser/translations/+lang/ka","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
