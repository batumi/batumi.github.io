კართული status report

* Android
 * There are Georgian keyboards which work well
 * There is no system localization for Georgian, most users use Russian system language
 * Even if you localize your app in Georgian it will never be available to users
 * Even if you put Georgian letters in your Russian localization on the app store it will asked to be corrected.
 * Reccomendations: Localize app in Russian and English, with Georgian content in the apk, but cannot do that in the app store.
 * Developers cannot publish apps from Georgia (neither paid nor free)
  
* Windows
 * Has a keyboard for Georgian
 * System langauge seems to be in Russian or English (not sure if Georgian is available)
 
* Facebook
 * Localization for Georgian is available and complete
 * Users who have iPhones who comment on friends posts cannot use a Georgian keyboard, so a certain percentage ~20%-30% of posts are in romanized kartuli, not in Georgian letters. So we created a Chrome extension "Kartuli Glasses" which turns all latin letters into Georgian for those Georgians who can read in Georgian but not in latin letters.
 
* Mac (Mavericks)
 * System can be put in Georgian, but no programs actually seem to implement it
